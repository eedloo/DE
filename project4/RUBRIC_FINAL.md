## Data Access and Formats (20/20 points)
_Uses data from at least two different formats: CSV, JSON, database, XML, Excel, etc_
* 

## Data Merging (20/20 points)
_Data from multiple sources must be joined together at least twice_
* 

## Data Aggregation and Pivoting (20/20 points)
_Data is aggregated or pivoted at least twice during the program_
* 

## Data Transformation (20/20 points)
_Some kind of field-level transformation is performed at least 5 times_
* 

## Feature Generation (20/20 points)
_The program must generate at least 5 new features derived from source data._
* 

## Problem Applicability (20/20 points)
_The program serves a theoretical purpose described in documentation, that could potentially do something practical in an industry of interest for you_
* Nice work!

## Modularity / Style (40/40 points)
